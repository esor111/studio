# Implementation Plan

- [ ] 1. Pre-removal analysis and verification




  - Document current build time and bundle size metrics
  - Verify all existing functionality works correctly before changes
  - Create comprehensive test of current application state
  - _Requirements: 4.1, 4.2, 4.3, 4.4_

- [x] 2. Search and verify no Genkit usage in codebase






  - Perform comprehensive search for any imports or references to Genkit
  - Verify that src/ai directory is truly unused by scanning all source files
  - Document any found references that need to be addressed
  - _Requirements: 3.1, 3.2_

- [x] 3. Remove Genkit AI directory and files



  - Delete the entire src/ai directory including genkit.ts and dev.ts files
  - Verify no other files import from the src/ai directory
  - Ensure removal doesn't break any existing imports
  - _Requirements: 2.1, 3.1_

- [x] 4. Remove Genkit runtime directory



  - Delete the .genkit directory and all its subdirectories
  - Remove .genkit/runtimes, .genkit/servers, .genkit/traces, .genkit/traces_idx
  - Verify directory removal is complete
  - _Requirements: 2.2_




- [ ] 5. Clean up .gitignore file
  - Remove .genkit/* pattern from .gitignore file
  - Ensure other ignore patterns remain intact
  - Verify .gitignore syntax is still valid after changes
  - _Requirements: 2.4_

- [x] 6. Verify package.json has no Genkit dependencies



  - Check dependencies and devDependencies for any Genkit-related packages
  - Remove any Genkit packages if found (genkit, @genkit-ai/*, etc.)
  - Update package-lock.json if dependencies were removed
  - _Requirements: 2.3, 1.2_

- [x] 7. Build verification and error checking


  - Run npm run build to verify project compiles successfully
  - Run npm run typecheck to ensure TypeScript validation passes
  - Fix any compilation errors that arise from the removal
  - _Requirements: 3.2, 3.4_

- [x] 8. Development server testing



  - Start development server with npm run dev
  - Verify server starts faster than before removal
  - Test that all pages load without runtime errors
  - _Requirements: 1.3, 3.3_

- [x] 9. Comprehensive functionality testing




  - Test dashboard page loads and displays correct data
  - Test topic creation, editing, and deletion functionality
  - Test subtopic management and rep counting features
  - Verify money calculations and progress tracking work correctly
  - _Requirements: 4.1, 4.2, 4.3_





- [ ] 10. Performance measurement and comparison
  - Measure new build time and compare with pre-removal metrics
  - Measure bundle size and verify reduction from baseline
  - Document development server startup time improvements



  - _Requirements: 1.2, 1.3_

- [ ] 11. Final cleanup and verification
  - Perform final search for any remaining Genkit references
  - Run complete build and test cycle one more time
  - Verify all animations, sounds, and UI interactions still work
  - _Requirements: 3.1, 4.4_
