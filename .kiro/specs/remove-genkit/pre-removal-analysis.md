# Pre-Removal Analysis Report

## Current State Analysis

### Genkit Files Found
- `src/ai/genkit.ts` - Contains Genkit configuration with googleAI plugin
- `src/ai/dev.ts` - Empty file with comment about flows

### Genkit Dependencies Status
- **Package.json**: No Genkit dependencies found in dependencies or devDependencies
- **Import Analysis**: No imports from src/ai directory found in codebase
- **Usage Analysis**: Genkit is only referenced within the src/ai directory itself

### Current Build Status
- **TypeScript Compilation**: FAILING due to missing Genkit dependencies
- **Build Process**: Cannot complete due to TypeScript errors
- **Key Issues**:
  - Missing 'genkit' module (src/ai/genkit.ts:1)
  - Missing '@genkit-ai/googleai' module (src/ai/genkit.ts:2)
  - Additional lucide-react type issues (unrelated to Genkit)

### Project Structure
```
src/ai/
├── genkit.ts (unused Genkit configuration)
└── dev.ts (empty file)

.genkit/ (runtime directory)
├── runtimes/
├── servers/
├── traces/
└── traces_idx/
```

## Baseline Metrics (Unable to Collect)

Due to the current build failures, baseline metrics cannot be collected at this time. The project appears to be in a state where:

1. Genkit dependencies were removed from package.json but files remain
2. TypeScript compilation fails due to missing Genkit modules
3. Build process cannot complete to measure bundle size

## Verification of Existing Functionality

### Current Application State
- **Build Status**: ❌ FAILING - Cannot build due to missing dependencies
- **TypeScript Check**: ❌ FAILING - 32 errors found
- **Development Server**: Not tested due to build issues

### Genkit Usage Verification
✅ **CONFIRMED**: Genkit is completely unused in the application
- No imports from src/ai directory in any source files
- Only references to genkit are in the src/ai files themselves
- Safe to remove without affecting functionality

## Recommendations

1. **Immediate Action**: Remove src/ai directory to resolve build issues
2. **Safe Removal**: Genkit removal will not impact existing functionality
3. **Build Recovery**: Removing Genkit files should restore build capability
4. **Metrics Collection**: Post-removal metrics can be collected once build is restored

## Next Steps

The pre-removal analysis confirms that:
- Genkit is completely unused and safe to remove
- Current build failures are caused by missing Genkit dependencies
- Removing Genkit files will likely restore build functionality
- No existing application features depend on Genkit

Proceeding with Genkit removal is recommended and necessary to restore project build capability.
